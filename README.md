# Path-Planning-in-Highways-for-an-Autonomous-Vehicle

### Overview:
The goal is to create a path planning pipeline that would smartly, safely, and comfortably navigate a virtual car around a virtual highway with other traffic. We are given a map of the highway, as well as sensor fusion and localization data about our car and nearby cars .We are supposed to give back a set of points (x , y)in a map that a perfect controller will execute every 0.02 seconds. Navigating safely and comfortably means we don’t bump into other cars, and we don’t exceed the maximum speed, acceleration, and jerk requirements. Navigating smartly means we change lanes when the car in front of us is too slow.

### Requirements:
- C++
- Visual Studio 2017 or later
